<h2>Marine ecosystems modeller 🌊🐋</h2>

### About me 👨‍💻
I am a marine ecologist fascinated by large pelagic species such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks 🦈. I am also very interested in both artisanal and industrial fishing, and their effects on ecosystems, people, and the economy🎣.
- I'm a PhD candidate in the basque country ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/186998f1-8675-4514-85f7-d8824a3d0491)
