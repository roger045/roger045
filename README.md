<h1>Hi! My name is Roger👋</h1>

<h2>Marine ecosystems modeller 🌊🐋</h2>

## I'm currently working on the ECOTUN-II project <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9675968f-eff2-4575-b625-3ceed6992fa8" alt="ECOTUN_logo_Roger_Amate" width="506" height="141">

### About me 👨‍💻
I am a marine ecologist fascinated by large pelagic species such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks 🦈. I am also very interested in both artisanal and industrial fishing, and their effects on ecosystems, people, and the economy🎣.
- 📝 I’m a PhD candidate currently working on crating an _Ecopath with Ecosim_(https://ecopath.org/) model of the oceanic pelagic ecosystem of the tropical Indian ocean.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to produce a better fitting of the Ecosim model.
- My main hobbys are running 🏃‍♂, cycling🚴‍♂️, swimming🏊‍♂️, cooking👨‍🍳, hiking🏔️, go to the sea🏝️, and learn about fishing🎣
