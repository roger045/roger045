Hi! My name is Roger👋

## About me 👨‍💻
I am a marine ecologist with a strong passion for uncovering the secrets of the oceans and the species that inhabit them. 🌊🐟 I am particularly fascinated by large pelagic species such as tunas, billfishes, sharks, and cetaceans. 🦈🐋 I also love learning about fishing. 🎣
